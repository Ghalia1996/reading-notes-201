#HTML text fundamentals:#
- headings and paragraphs
- Lists
- Emphasis and importance

*One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure and meaning (also known as semantics) so that a browser can display it correctly.*
#What is CSS?#

**CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS. Think of HTML as the foundation (every house has one), and CSS as the aesthetic choices (there’s a big difference between a Victorian mansion and a mid-century modern home).**
#how dose CSS work ?#
*CSS brings style to your web pages by interacting with HTML elements. Elements are the individual HTML components of a web page—for instance a paragraph—which in HTML might look like this:

<p>This is my paragraph!</p>
If you wanted to make this paragraph appear pink and bold to people viewing your web page through a web browser, you’d use CSS code that looks like this:

p  {  color:pink;  font-weight:bold;  }
In this case, “p” (the paragraph) is called the “selector”—it’s the part of CSS code specifying which HTML element the CSS styling will effect. In CSS, the selector is written to the left of the first curly bracket. The information between curly brackets is called a declaration, and it contains properties and values that are applied to the selector. Properties are things like font size, color, and margins, while values are the settings for those properties. In the example above, “color” and “font-weight” are both properties, and “pink” and “bold” are values. The full bracketed set of

{  color:pink;  font-weight:bold;  } 
is the declaration, and again, “p” (meaning the HTML paragraph) is the selector. These same basic principles can be applied to change font sizes, background colors, margin indentations, and more. For instance. . .

body  {  background-color:lightblue;  }
. . .would make your page’s background light blue, or. . .

p  {  font-size:20px;  color:red;  }
. . .will create a 20 point font paragraph with red letters.*

#What is JavaScript ?#
*JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.

The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
Designed for creating network-centric applications.
Complementary to and integrated with Java.
Complementary to and integrated with HTML.
Open and cross-platform*

#JavaScript Switch Statement#
**The JavaScript switch statement is used in decision making.
The switch statement evaluates an expression and executes the corresponding body that matches the expression's result.**
*The syntax of the switch statement is:*

> switch(variable/expression) {
    case value1:  
        // body of case 1
        break;

    case value2:  
        // body of case 2
        break;

    case valueN:
        // body of case N
        break;

    default:
        // body of default
}
**The switch statement evaluates a variable/expression inside parentheses ().

If the result of the expression is equal to value1, its body is executed.
If the result of the expression is equal to value2, its body is executed.
This process goes on. If there is no matching case, the default body executes.**
